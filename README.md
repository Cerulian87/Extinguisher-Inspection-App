# Extinguisher-Inspection-App
## Fullstack Capstone project for MSU Denver's AHEC required for course CIS4050


An explination for this full stack web as is as follows:
  AHEC, Auroria Higher Education Center, needs a system to replace their current fire extinguisher inspection methods which include hand written logs - 
  as well as multipe spreadsheets that have many redundancies. We're proposing a web app that uses Django's backend to manage a database, api, and - 
  authentication, which is utilizing Django RestFramework. The front end, which is written using React.js, will handle all user interfacing and inputs.
  The frontend and backend will also be utilizing Django Cors Headers to mitigate issues between the two platforms when sharing resources. This app - 
  essentially will need to give all types of extinguisher inpsection employees a platform to conduct their procedures and maintain orderly logs.
 
 
# Dependancies include:
## Backend:
  - Python v3.10
  - Python venv (virtual environment)
  - Django 4.1.7
  - Django-Cors-Headers 3.14
  - Django RestFramework
  - Django RestFramework-SimpleJWT
  
## Frontend:
  - Node 19.8.1
  - React 18.2
  - React-Router-Dom 6.10
  
# Installation guide:

- Open up your command line and type: python --version. If not installed, go to [Python Website](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Also check for Node with: node -v. If not installed, go to [Node Website](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- ..To be continued
